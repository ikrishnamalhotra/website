            <h2>The Echo of Tomorrow</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>My phone buzzed on the nightstand, startling me awake. 3:17 AM. Groggily, I fumbled for it, squinting at the screen. A text message. From… me? The contact name read "Me (Future)." My blood ran cold. Dismissing it as a prank, I almost deleted it. But the message itself stopped me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>_"DON'T GO TO SCHOOL. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, LEAVE THE HOUSE. TRUST ME. - You."_</p>
<p></p>
<p>My own name. Sent from my own number. From 24 hours in the future. Ridiculous. Impossible. And yet, a creeping unease settled in my stomach. I knew myself. I wouldn’t play a prank like this. Something was terribly, terribly wrong.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>I. The Seed of Doubt:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sleep was impossible. The text message pulsed in my mind with every heartbeat. Was it real? Could it be some kind of elaborate hoax? But the urgency in the words... it felt authentic. I spent the next few hours researching time travel, parallel universes, anything that could remotely explain what was happening. Google searches yielded only sci-fi theories and conspiracy websites, offering no solace, only fueling the growing fear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By sunrise, the message had become a gnawing obsession. I knew I should ignore it. It defied logic. But what if... what if it was true?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>II. The Breaking Point:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The school bus rumbled down the street, its familiar screech a shrill reminder of my impending doom…or potential safety. I watched it from my window, a knot tightening in my chest. My friends would be wondering where I was. My teachers would mark me absent. But the alternative... the potential consequence of ignoring the text… it paralyzed me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bus disappeared around the corner. I'd made my decision.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The day crawled by, each hour a torturous eternity. I stayed glued to my phone, expecting another message, another clue, another piece of the puzzle. Nothing. Just the oppressive silence of my empty house, amplified by my racing thoughts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>III. The Unraveling:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM, I started feeling… off. A strange tingling sensation in my head. A feeling of being watched, even though I was alone. I tried to rationalize it as anxiety, but the feeling intensified, growing into a full-blown panic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly, my phone vibrated. Another text from "Me (Future)."</p>
<p></p>
<p>_"It's happening now. Don't look at the window. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOOK AT THE WINDOW!"_</p>
<p></p>
<p>My heart leaped into my throat. I instinctively turned towards the living room window, but forced myself to look away. Don't look. Don't look. The words screamed in my head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But curiosity, that insidious force, proved too strong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Slowly, trembling, I turned my head.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>IV. The Glimpse:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Standing in my front yard was… me. But not me. This version of me was gaunt, pale, with eyes that were hollow and devoid of life. It wore the clothes I was wearing now, but they were torn and stained with what looked suspiciously like… blood. It stood perfectly still, its gaze fixed on me, a silent, horrifying warning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before I could scream, the figure lunged forward, slamming into the window with a sickening thud. The glass spiderwebbed, but held. The creature… my future self… continued to beat against the window, its eyes burning into mine, a silent plea mixed with primal rage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>V. The End is the Beginning:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I scrambled backwards, tripping over the coffee table and falling to the floor. The window continued to buckle under the relentless assault. I knew it wouldn't hold for long. I had to get out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I grabbed my phone, desperately trying to call for help, but the signal was gone. Dead. I was completely alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the glass finally shattered, showering the room with shards, I saw another text message arrive. This time, from a new contact: "Me (Future + 24 Hours)."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The message read:</p>
<p></p>
<p>_"Remember this day. When you wake up tomorrow, don't trust anyone. ESPECIALLY… yourself."_</p>
<p></p>
<p>The creature, once me, was now inside, clawing at me, a silent, desperate scream caught in its throat. It wanted something. It <em>needed<em> something. But what?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The last thing I saw before everything went black was the monstrous version of me pointing frantically at my phone, the same phone I now held in my hand. The phone that would, in 24 hours, become a harbinger of my own doom. The cycle had begun. And I was trapped inside.</p>
