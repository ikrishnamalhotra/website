            <p>Okay, here's a horror story following your prompt and guidelines:</p>
<p></p>
<p># Porcelain Smiles</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The crumpled ad in Sarah's pocket read: <em>Babysitter Needed - Excellent Pay. Call the Ashtons.<em>  Excellent pay was right; $20 an hour to watch two kids who looked like they belonged on a vintage postcard?  Sarah, strapped for cash and dreaming of a new guitar, hadn’t hesitated. Now, standing in the Ashton's excessively manicured garden, she was starting to feel a prickle of unease. The house was <em>too<em> perfect, the lawn <em>too<em> green, the silence... unnerving.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Job:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Ashton, a man with eyes like polished stones, had given her strangely precise instructions. “Eliza and Thomas are…particular,” he’d said, his voice a low rumble. “They have specific routines. Follow them <em>exactly<em>. No deviations.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He’d handed her a typed schedule:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>   <strong>6:00 PM:<strong> Dinner – Creamed Spinach, Fish (Cod, prepared precisely as instructed) – Serve in silence.</p>
<p><em>   <strong>7:00 PM:<strong> Recitation – From provided text. (He indicated a worn, leather-bound book.)</p>
<p><em>   <strong>8:00 PM:<strong> Bath – Water temperature precisely 98.6 degrees. No bubbles.</p>
<p><em>   <strong>9:00 PM:<strong> Bedtime – Lights out. Doors must remain ajar – precisely 3 inches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Any questions?" he'd asked, his gaze unwavering.  Sarah, overwhelmed, had only managed a weak, "No."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Children:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Eliza and Thomas were… unsettling.  They were beautiful, eerily so.  Their skin was porcelain-smooth, their eyes wide and unnervingly still.  They moved with a strange, deliberate grace.  During dinner, they ate in complete silence, their movements robotic as they consumed the pale, gelatinous fish.  No expression flickered across their faces.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The recitation was worse.  The text, written in archaic English, spoke of ancient rituals, of binding and servitude.  Eliza and Thomas chanted the words in perfect unison, their voices high and thin, like the sound of glass chimes in a storm.  Sarah felt a cold dread creep into her bones.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Something is Wrong:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The bath was the turning point. As Sarah tested the water, she noticed something bobbing in the tub. She fished it out with a shudder, finding a perfectly human-looking tooth. Her heart began to hammer in her chest. This wasn't normal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Later, while getting them ready for bed, she saw it. A seam. A barely perceptible line running from Eliza's hairline down the side of her neck. It looked like a crack on a doll. Sarah's breath hitched. They weren't children. They were <em>things<em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Discovery:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Driven by a terrifying curiosity, Sarah waited until she thought the children were asleep and then, armed with her phone flashlight, she crept into their room. The door was ajar, exactly three inches.  She pushed it open further.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eliza and Thomas were sitting upright in their beds, their eyes open, staring straight ahead.  Their porcelain faces were illuminated by the moonlight, making the seams even more apparent. They didn't blink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, Eliza moved.  Slowly, deliberately, she reached up and, with a sickening <em>crack<em>, pulled her face off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sarah screamed, stumbling back.  Beneath the mask of perfection was a grotesque tangle of wires, gears, and something that looked disturbingly like dried flesh. Thomas did the same, revealing a similar horror.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Hunt:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The "children" lurched out of bed, their movements jerky and unnatural.  They made no sound, but their eyes, now glowing with a malevolent red light, were fixed on her. Sarah knew she had to get out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She fled through the house, the things shambling after her.  The perfect order of the house now seemed like a trap.  She tried the front door, but it was locked. The windows were sealed shut.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She ran to the kitchen and grabbed the largest knife she could find. The creatures were closing in, their faces discarded on the floor. Sarah backed against the counter, her breath coming in ragged gasps. They were relentless, their movements unsettlingly precise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As they lunged, Sarah screamed again, raising the knife.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Conclusion:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The last thing Sarah saw was the cold, unfeeling gleam of their metallic eyes and the mechanical snap of their jaws.  The house remained silent, the garden perfectly manicured. The ad remained crumpled in the pocket of her jeans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ashtons would need a new babysitter soon. The schedule was already printed. Everything had to remain the same. And somewhere in the depths of the perfectly manicured garden, the gears of Eliza and Thomas began to whir once more, waiting for their next victim with their porcelain smiles.</p>
