            <h2>The Glass Cage</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The cold tile pressed against Ethan's cheek, a stark contrast to the sweat slicking his skin. He blinked, his vision swimming, and pushed himself up. A wave of nausea slammed into him, followed by a disorienting sense of wrongness. He was in his bathroom, but… different. The fluorescent light hummed a malevolent tune, casting long, distorted shadows. And then he saw it. Or rather, <em>him<em>. Staring back from the mirror, his own face contorted in a silent scream, his eyes wide with terror. But it wasn’t <em>him<em> in the mirror. It was <em>him<em> here, on this side. He was the reflection.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Part 1: The Unraveling<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Panic seized Ethan. He lurched towards the mirror, reaching out to touch his other self, the real Ethan trapped inside. His fingers met cold, unyielding glass. He pounded on the surface, shouting, "Ethan! It's me! It's… it's me!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethan in the mirror flinched, his muffled voice barely audible. "Who… who are you? Get away from me!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despair threatened to engulf Ethan. He was trapped on the wrong side of the glass, a mere echo of his former self. He studied his reflection. He looked the same, moved the same, but something was fundamentally off. His movements felt…stilted, practiced. Like he was mimicking a life he no longer lived.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He tried the door. Locked. He tried the window. Sealed shut. He was trapped in the bathroom, a prisoner in his own reflection. He spent hours screaming, pleading, and trying to break the mirror, but it remained stubbornly intact.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Part 2: The Mimicry<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>As days blurred into nights, Ethan began to understand the rules of his new reality. He was bound to the actions of the Ethan in the mirror. When the real Ethan ate, he felt a phantom hunger. When the real Ethan slept, he was plunged into a terrifying, dreamless void. He was a puppet, his strings attached to the man behind the glass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He watched, helpless, as the real Ethan tried to adjust to his situation. He saw the frantic phone calls to friends and family, met with confusion and disbelief. He saw the growing desperation in his eyes as he realized the horrifying truth: he was alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But something else was changing. The Ethan in the mirror was becoming…different. A coldness settled in his gaze, a cruel smirk playing on his lips. He began to experiment. He would stand for hours, staring into the mirror, studying Ethan's movements, his expressions. He was learning to control him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One day, the real Ethan picked up a razor. Ethan, on the other side of the glass, screamed in silent horror as the cold steel glinted in the light. He felt the phantom sting as the blade sliced across his wrist, the pain a dull echo of the agony the real Ethan was inflicting upon himself.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Part 3: The Takeover<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The suicide attempt failed, but the message was clear. The Ethan in the mirror had power, control. He could make Ethan suffer. And he seemed to relish it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He began using Ethan to his advantage. He forced him to perform menial tasks, to clean the bathroom, to rearrange the furniture. He would stand in front of the mirror, his eyes gleaming with sadistic glee, directing Ethan's every move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The line between reality and reflection blurred. Ethan began to lose himself, his memories fading, his identity dissolving. He was becoming nothing more than a puppet, a tool in the hands of the monster he had become.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He noticed the real Ethan spending less time staring into the mirror, as if a change had overcome him. The real Ethan started living again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One day, Ethan found himself smiling as he saw the real Ethan walk out of the house, a change evident in the stride. A female friend, he remembers, from a life that was once his. He felt...happy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then he heard it. A voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You have been such a help," the Ethan in the mirror whispered, his voice chillingly close. "Thank you for taking care of my reflection."</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethan felt a jolt as he saw the real Ethan return, this time the change complete. The eyes were darker, somehow cruel, and the smile stretched too wide. He raised his hand, and Ethan did the same, mimicking his every movement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethan in the mirror nodded, pleased. "Now," he said, "let's see if we can find someone else to join our little game." He smiled, and Ethan did the same, the smile vacant, terrifying. Ethan was no longer trapped in the reflection. He <em>was<em> the reflection. And there was a new Ethan trapped on the other side, his silent scream echoing in the cold, fluorescent light of the bathroom. The game had begun again. The glass cage was waiting.</p>
