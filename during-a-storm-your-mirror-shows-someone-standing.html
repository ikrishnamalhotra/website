            <p>Okay, here's a horror story written according to your specifications:</p>
<p></p>
<p># Reflected Terror</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of my old Victorian house. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the world outside into a swirling, grey chaos. I was alone, huddled in my room, trying to lose myself in a book, but the storm's fury kept tugging at my nerves. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the room, and in that brief, stark light, I glanced at the antique mirror hanging on my wall. It was an ornate thing, a family heirloom, with a heavy, gilded frame that always seemed a little too imposing. Usually, I paid it no mind. But tonight, something was terribly, irrevocably wrong.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Reflection:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another lightning strike. Another flash. This time, my heart leaped into my throat. In the mirror, I saw myself, pale and wide-eyed. But behind my reflection, standing just over my shoulder, was another figure. Tall and gaunt, wreathed in shadow. Its face was obscured, hidden in darkness, but I could sense its presence, a cold, malevolent energy that seemed to seep out of the glass and into my soul.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I whipped around, my chair scraping against the wooden floor. Nothing. Just the empty space behind me, the storm raging outside.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>It was just a trick of the light,<em> I told myself, my voice trembling. <em>Just my imagination running wild.<em></p>
<p></p>
<p>I tried to focus on my book, but the image was burned into my mind. The shadowy figure, impossibly close. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Game of Glimpses:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I couldn't resist. I glanced back at the mirror. This time, the figure was clearer. Though the face was still hidden in shadow, I could make out the distinct shape of a long, thin hand resting on my shoulder. Not <em>my<em> shoulder, but the shoulder of my reflection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A wave of nausea washed over me. I forced myself to look away, to breathe. I told myself I was exhausted, stressed from school, letting the storm get to me. But deep down, I knew this was something more, something far more sinister.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next flash of lightning brought a fresh wave of terror. The figure was closer now. I could see the faint outline of eyes glowing in the darkness. They were fixed on me, cold and predatory. And then, a chilling detail: a thin, almost invisible thread of smoke seemed to curl from the figure's mouth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each flash brought the figure closer, clearer. It was as if it were slowly pulling itself out of the mirror, into my reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Confrontation:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The storm reached its peak. The house groaned under the relentless assault of wind and rain. I stared into the mirror, paralyzed with fear. The figure was practically standing on top of me now. I could feel its breath on my neck, cold and stale like the air in a tomb.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the shadowy face began to resolve, revealing sunken eyes, a gaunt, skeletal face and a thin, cruel mouth pulled back in a perpetual snarl. The smoke emanated from this maw like a whisper of death itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Who are you?" I managed to choke out, my voice barely audible above the storm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The figure didn't speak, but the reflection in the mirror twisted into a grotesque mockery of my own face. The eyes, the mouth, the very skin seemed to melt and reform into something utterly alien and horrifying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, the reflection reached out, its hand passing through the glass. I felt an icy grip on my shoulder, digging into my flesh.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Escape?<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I screamed, a primal sound of pure terror. I ripped myself away from the mirror, stumbled backwards, and slammed into my desk. The impact sent books and papers flying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I scrambled to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest, and ran. I didn't know where I was going, I just had to get away from the mirror, from the figure that was now undoubtedly free from its glassy prison.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I burst out of my room and down the stairs, the house creaking and groaning around me. I didn't dare look back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I reached the front door, fumbled with the lock, and threw it open. The wind and rain lashed at me, but I didn't care. I plunged out into the storm, desperate to escape the horror that was now lurking inside my house.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:<strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I ran until I couldn't run anymore, until my lungs burned and my legs trembled. I collapsed on the rain-soaked ground, gasping for breath, the storm raging around me. Safe? I don't know what will come next.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, days later, every reflective surface sends shivers down my spine. Every shadow seems to hold a hidden threat. Because I know, with a certainty that chills me to the bone, that it’s not just the mirror I need to fear. It's the fact that whatever that <em>thing<em> is, it's not trapped anymore. And it's still looking for me. And maybe...it's standing right behind me now.</p>
